# Web-App interface

## ℹ️ Info

The files contained in this directory are required for accessing the web interface. The HTML files are built and compressed into a single line by using the [BuildWebApp.py](./Source/BuildWebApp.py) Python script located in the [./Source](./Source) directory. The source files of the web app can also be found there. After applying any changes to the source, they have to be rebuilt, recompressed and then copied back into this directory.
