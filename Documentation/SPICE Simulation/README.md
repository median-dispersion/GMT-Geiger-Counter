# SPICE Simulation

## 💿 Softaware

The SPICE simulation software used for this project can be found at: https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html. It is an awesome interactive HTML5 / JavaScript web app developed by Paul Falstad and Iain Sharp and can be used directly in the browser.

## ⏬ Importing Circuits

To import a circuit, simply click on `File > Open File` and select the desired `.txt` file. Alternatively, open the chosen `.txt` file in a text editor and copy it's content, then click on `File > Import From Text`, paste the copied content into the text box and click `OK`.

## 🗒️ Note

Sometimes component values might differ from the ones used in the actual circuit, this is because the simulation is not always 100% accurate and through real world testing another value was determent to be more optimal.
