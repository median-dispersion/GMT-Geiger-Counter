## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

This is a hobby project and should not be relied upon to accurately determine radiation levels, especially not if those radiation levels are potentially dangerous and or lethal!

## 🧩 Tube Compatibility

The tube driver PCB is compatible with a variety of Geiger-Müller tubes. Any tube that has a total length including the contacts of **110mm** to **107mm** or **90mm** to **87mm** and operates around **400V DC** should be physically compatible. Here are some tubes that will be compatible with this Geiger counter:
