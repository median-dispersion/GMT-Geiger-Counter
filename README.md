## ‚öôÔ∏è Features, Settings & Usage

### Geiger counter

#### Main Screen

The main Geiger counter display shows the equivalent dose, a radiation intensity rating, the counts-per-minute reading, and the integration time. From this screen, you can also access and navigate to all other system functions.

| **1**  | **Main Equivalent Dose Screen** - Displays the equivalent dose in your selected unit, calculated over the current integration time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **5**  | **Integration Time** - The number of seconds the Geiger counter averages measurements to calculate CPM and equivalent dose. Shorter integration times provide more precise readings at high radiation levels; longer times are better for low radiation levels. The counter automatically adjusts this setting but it can also be manually increased or decreased. |

### Cosmic ray detector

The cosmic ray detector measures cosmic ray exposure by recording coincidence events, which are shown on this screen. While the detector is enabled, its data is also available via the serial console, the wireless API interface and the log file.

| **1** | **Main Coincidence Events Screen** - Shows the total number of coincidence events recorded since the cosmic ray detector was enabled. This value resets when the cosmic ray detector is disabled.                                    |
| **2** | **Coincidence Events per Hour** - Displays the hourly average since the cosmic ray detector was enabled. This value resets when the cosmic ray detector is disabled.                                                                 |
| **3** | **Total Coincidence Events (Since Power-On)** - A sum of all coincidence events recorded since the device was powered on. This value only increases when the cosmic ray detector is enabled, but does not reset when it is disabled. |
| **4** | Tap to **temporarily mute detection sounds**. Tap again to re-enable them. This only mutes regular detection sounds; other alerts will still play.                                                                                   |

| **7** | **Follower Tube Detections** - The total number of detections by the follower tube since the cosmic ray detector was enabled. This value resets when the cosmic ray detector is disabled.                                            |
| **8** | Tap to **exit the cosmic ray detector** and return to the Geiger counter screen. A prompt will ask whether to disable the detector or keep it running in the background.                                                             |

### True random number generator

The true random number generator produces truly random numbers. You can set a custom range from 1 to 99, then roll to generate a number, which appears on the main result screen. While the generator is enabled, the Geiger counter is disabled. During this time, a continuous stream of random bits is also available via the serial console and wireless API interface.

## üß© Tube Compatibility

The tube driver PCB is compatible with a variety of Geiger-M√ºller tubes. Any tube that has a total length including the contacts of **110mm** to **107mm** or **90mm** to **87mm** and operates around **400V DC** should be physically compatible. Here are some tubes that will be compatible with this Geiger counter:

| Tube       | Compatible | Tested | Note                                          |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| SBM-20     | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ      | The tube this Geiger counter was designed for |
| STS-5      | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå      | The predecessor tube to the SBM-20            |
| J305 107mm | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå      | A modern alternative to the SBM-20            |
| J305 90mm  | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå      | A shorter version of the J305 107mm           |
| M4011      | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå      | An alternative to the J305 90mm               |
